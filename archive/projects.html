                        Something I've been wanting to do for a while now is
                        make a discord bot.<br />
                        For whatever reasons, I never really got around to it,
                        at least, not until a few years later (now).<br />
                        The functionality of this bot is minimal currently, it's
                        mostly just so I could learn the concepts.<br />
                        Here is some code from it.
